# Lotto-Award-Checking-System
This project simulates a Lotto award checking system. The system facilitates up to 1000 players to play Lotto and check their game status. The system is designed to generate random data for Lotto draws and to implement various functionalities to check the status of each player's game-numbers against winning numbers.
